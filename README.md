## Arduino library for Flash Memory Chips (SPI based only)
<sup> Download the latest stable release from [here](https://github.com/Marzogh/SPIFlash/releases/latest). Please report any bugs in [issues](https://github.com/Marzogh/SPIFlash/issues/new).</sup>

This Arduino library is for use with flash memory chips that communicate using the SPI protocol. In its current form it supports identifying the flash chip and its various features; automatic address allocation and management; writing and reading a number of different types of data, ranging from 8-bit to 32-bit (signed and unsigned) values, floats, Strings, arrays of bytes/chars and structs to and from various locations; sector, block and chip erase; and powering down for low power operation.

>### Important note from developer
>The term 'SPI Flash' is a fairly common way to refer to Flash memory chips that communicate over the SPI protocol and there are a number of libraries that are named SPIFlash. When I first started work on this library in 2014, it was mostly as an exercise to improve my embedded systems programming skills. When I asked for it to be included in the list of Arduino libraries, I did not really expect it to go very far or get very popular. But, before I knew it, I was releasing new versions every other month and I found the number of users got way bigger than I imagined it would. The amount of traffic the GitHub repository gets still surprises me.
>
>A few months ago, @LowPowerLab raised an issue ([#83](https://github.com/Marzogh/SPIFlash/issues/83)) about the problems the name of this library was causing the users of his library - also called SPIFlash. The fact that this library is in the Arduino Library manager meant that his users were being asked to upgrade their version of SPIFlash when the libraries were actually different. I can understand how much of an annoyance this can be for a user.
>
>@LowPowerLab's version of SPIFlash has been around for longer than this one and his library is a major part of his commercial line of development boards. Since I am a hobbyist developer (I'm a full-time geneticist & a part-time dabbler in ecology - if you're curious) and this library is not a commercial product with branding and trademarks to worry about, the least I can do is change the name of this library so it stops being an annoyance to @LowPowerLab's customers.
>> On a side note, if you did not know already, @LowPowerLab makes and sells a fantastic line of Arduino compatible boards - the [Moteino](https://lowpowerlab.com/shop/) series - and has developed a fantastic IoT protocol to use with them to add smarts to your home. In January this year, I finally got around to getting my hands on some of his boards and have been playing around with them. They are fantastic! I'd strongly recommend you check them out - if you haven't already done so.
>
>I asked the Arduino developers if there was a way to migrate this library to a new name without breaking the upgrade path ([Issue #6904](https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/issues/6904)) and was told that it was not possible. The only way is to pull my version of SPIFlash from the library manager and ask for a renamed version to be included in the library manager after.
>
>So, this is what I have decided to do.:
>- This version - v3.1.0 - will be the last version to be released under the SPIFlash name.
>- Anyone downloading this version of the library will be able to read this notice in the ReadMe file.
>- Anyone using this version of the library will see a notice in their Serial output directing them to this notice in the ReadMe file. (this can be removed by commenting out the `#define PRINTNAMECHANGEALERT` in `SPIFlash.h`)
>- Version 3.2.0 will be released in a couple of months (in May most likely) under a new name - SPIMemory.
>- This version of SPIFlash will be removed from the library manager then and replaced with the new one.
>
>The only change will have to be made in end-user code will be to change the `#include SPIFlash.h` to `#include SPIMemory.h`. After the name change, rest assured that older versions will remain accessible and the development history of the library will be preserved.
>
>I apologise for any trouble this might cause you as the end user, but, given the facts, it is the only thing I can do to be fair to @LowPowerLab
>
>Thanks again for using `SPIFlash` and I hope you will continue to find it useful in whatever new name it will take on.

NOTE: ESP32 boards usually have an SPIFlash already attached to their SS pin, so the user has to declare the ChipSelect pin being used when the constructor is declared - for example
```
SPIFlash flash(33);
```

  - S25FL127S

##### Should work with (Similar enough to the ones actually tested with)
- Winbond (All SPI Flash chips)
- Microchip (SST25 & SST26 series)
- Cypress/Spansion (S25FL series)

### Installation

#### Option 1
- Open the Arduino IDE.
- Go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage libraries.
- Search for SPIFlash.
- Install the latest version.

#### Option 2
- Click on the 'Clone or download' button above the list of files on this <a href = "https://github.com/Marzogh/SPIFlash/tree/master"> page </a>.
- Select Download ZIP. A .zip file will download to your computer.
- Unzip the archive and rename resulting folder to 'SPIFlash'
- Move the folder to your libraries folder (~/sketches/libraries)

### Usage

- The library is called by declaring the```SPIFlash flash(csPin*)``` constructor where 'flash' can be replaced by a user constructor of choice and 'csPin' is the Chip Select pin for the flash module.

    <sub>* Optional. Do not include csPin if using the default slave select pin for your board.</sub>
- Every version of the library >= v3.0.0 supports the ability to use any of multiple SPI interfaces (if your micro-controller supports them). Switching to use another SPI interface is done by calling ```SPIFlash flash(csPin, &SPI1);``` (or &SPI2 and so on), instead of ```SPIFlash flash(csPin)```.

    <sub>* NOTE: This is currently only supported on the SAMD and STM32 architectures.</sub>
- Also make sure to include ```flash.begin(CHIPSIZE*)``` in ```void setup()```. This enables the library to detect the type of flash chip installed and load the right parameters.

    <sub>* Optional</sub>

##### Notes on Address overflow and Error checking
- The library has Address overflow enabled by default - i.e. if the last address read/written from/to,  in any function, is 0xFFFFF then, the next address read/written from/to is 0x00000. This can be disabled by uncommenting ```#define DISABLEOVERFLOW``` in SPIFlash.h. (Address overflow only works for Read / Write functions. Erase functions erase only a set number of blocks/sectors irrespective of overflow.)
- All write functions have Error checking turned on by default - i.e. every byte written to the flash memory will be checked against the data stored on the Arduino. Users who require greater write speeds can disable this function by setting an optional last 'errorCheck' argument in any write function to NOERRCHK - For eg. call the function ```writeByte(address, *data_buffer, NOERRCHK)``` instead of ```writeByte(address, *data_buffer)```.

The library enables the following functions:
<hr>

#### Non-Read/Write functions
<hr>

###### `begin(_chipsize*)`
Must be called at the start in setup(). This function detects the type of chip being used and sets parameters accordingly. An optional CHIPSIZE parameter can be declared as an argument with this function. For supported CHIPSIZE values, please refer to the appropriate [wiki section](https://github.com/Marzogh/SPIFlash/wiki/Chipsize) or look at defines.h .

###### `setClock(clockSpeed)`
Must be called straight after begin(). This function takes a 32-bit number as replacement for the default maximum clock speed (104MHz for Winbond NOR flash) thereby initiating future SPI transactions with the user-defined clock speed. Use with care.

###### `error(_verbosity)`
Returns the (8-bit) error code generated by the function called immediately before this is called. If the optional VERBOSE argument is used, a verbose troubleshooting report is printed to Serial. Refer to the [Error reporting](https://github.com/Marzogh/SPIFlash/wiki/Error-reporting) section the Wiki for further reference.

###### `getManID()`
Returns the Manufacturer ID as a 16-bit value.

###### `getJEDECID()`
Returns the JEDEC ID as a 32-bit value.

###### `getUniqueID()`
Returns the Unique ID as a 64-bit value.

###### `getAddress(sizeOfData)`
Gets the next available address for use. Has two variants:
* Takes the size of the data as an argument and returns a 32-bit address
* Takes a three variables, the size of the data and two other variables to return a page number value & an offset into.

In library versions >= v3.0.0 This function can be called anytime - even if there is preexisting data on the flash chip. It will simply find the next empty address block for the data.

###### sizeofStr()
Use this function to find the size of a String to use as the argument in getAddress(size). Using size = sizeof(String) will cause the getAddress(size) function to fail.

size = sizeof(variable) can be used for all types of data but String objects.

###### getCapacity()
Returns the capacity in bytes as a 32-bit value.

###### getMaxPage()
Returns the maximum number of pages in the flash memory as a 32-bit value.

###### functionRunTime()
Returns the time taken to run a function. Must be called immediately after a function is run as the variable returned is overwritten each time a function from this library is called. Primarily used in the diagnostics sketch included in the library to track function time.
<sub> NOTE: Can only be called when '#define RUNDIAGNOSTIC' is uncommented in SPIFlash.h</sub>

<hr>

<hr>

##### Continuous read/write commands
<sub>
All write commands take a boolean last argument 'errorCheck'. This argument defaults to TRUE, but when set to FALSE will more than double the writing speed. This however comes at the cost of checking for writing errors. Use with care.
</sub>
<hr>

###### readByteArray(address, *data_buffer, bufferSize)
Reads an array of bytes starting from a specific address Takes the address (0-maxAddress) & a data_buffer - i.e. an array of bytes to be read from the flash memory - and size of the array as arguments. ```uint8_t data_buffer[n];``` The data buffer **must** be an array of n **bytes**. 'n' is determined by the amount of RAM available on the Arduino board.

###### writeByteArray(address, *data_buffer, bufferSize)
Writes an array of bytes starting from a specific address. Takes the address (0-maxAddress) & a data_buffer - i.e. an array of bytes to be written to the flash memory - and size of the array as arguments. ```uint8_t data_buffer[n];``` The data buffer **must** be an array of 'n' **bytes**. The number of bytes - 'n' - is determined by the amount of RAM available on the Arduino board.

###### readCharArray(address, *data_buffer, bufferSize)
Reads an array of chars starting from a specific address. Takes the address (0-maxAddress) & a data_buffer - i.e. an array of chars to be read from the flash memory - and size of the array as arguments. ```char data_buffer[n];``` The data buffer **must** be an array of n **chars**.

The number of chars - 'n' - is determined by the amount of RAM available on the Arduino board.
<hr>

##### Erase commands
<sub>
All erase commands only take a 32-bit address variable instead of the optional 16-bit page number & 8-bit offset variables in previous versions of the library (< v3.0.0)
</sub>
<hr>

###### eraseSector(address)
Erases one 4KB sector - 16 pages - containing the address to be erased. The sectors are numbered 0 - 255 containing 16 pages each.
Page 0-15 --> Sector 0; Page 16-31 --> Sector 1;......Page 4080-4095 --> Sector 255, and so on...

###### eraseBlock32K(address)
Erases one 32KB block - 128 pages - containing the address to be erased. The blocks are numbered 0 - 31 containing 128 pages each.
Page 0-127 --> Block 0; Page 128-255 --> Block 1;......Page 3968-4095 --> Block 31, and so on...

###### eraseBlock64K(address)
Erases one 64KB block - 256 pages - containing the address to be erased. The blocks are numbered 0 - 15 containing 256 pages each.
// Page 0-255 --> Block 0; Page 256-511 --> Block 1;......Page 3840-4095 --> Block 15, and so on...

###### eraseChip()
Erases entire chip. Use with care.

###### eraseSection(address, sizeOfData)
Erases the specific number of blocks/sectors to fit data (size defined by the sizeOfData arguement) into. When a user requires a large and variable (between writes) amount of data to be written to the flash memory on the fly and to have the correct amount of space erased to fit the data, this function will automatically calculate and erase the right amount of space to fit the data.

Please note that if the the amount of data being written is consistently the same size, the pre-existing 'flash.eraseSector()', 'flash.eraseBlock32K()' and 'flash.eraseBlock64K()' functions will operate a lot faster.
<hr>

##### Suspend/Resume commands
<hr>

###### suspendProg()
Suspends current Block Erase/Sector Erase/Page Program. Does not suspend chipErase(). Page Program, Write Status Register, Erase instructions are not allowed. Erase suspend is only allowed during Block/Sector erase. Program suspend is only allowed during Page/Quad Page Program

###### resumeProg()
Resumes previously suspended Block Erase/Sector Erase/Page Program.
<hr>

##### Power operation commands
<hr>

###### powerDown()
Puts device in low power state. Useful for battery powered operations. Typical current consumption during power-down is 1mA with a maximum of 5mA. (Datasheet 7.4). In powerDown() the chip will only respond to powerUp()

###### powerUp()
Wakes chip from low power state.
<hr>

###### How to get data off Flash memory via Serial
<sub>(Works only for Unix based Operating Systems)</sub>

 - Make sure you include code to let you dump entire flash memory/specific address' content to Serial (Refer to the code in the _TestFlash.h_ for details on how to do this)
 - Connect your Arduino board to the computer.
 - Open the Arduino IDE, the IDE's Serial Monitor, and an OSX POSIX terminal.
 - Type the following command into the terminal window. ```% tail -f /dev/tty.usbmodem1411 > FlashDump.txt``` Make sure to replace the _/dev/tty.usbmodem1411_ with the port your arduino is connected to. (You can find this in Tools --> Ports in Arduino IDE 1.6.x)
 - Then type the command to read all pages into the Serial console. If you use my code from the example file the command is ```read_all_pages```
 - Wait a few seconds before typing ```Ctrl+C``` to end the tail process
 - Check that you have actually received all the data by typing ```% cat FlashDump.txt```. This should output the entire text file into your terminal window.
